{"name":"Ipv6droid","tagline":"IPv6 tunnel client for use on Android","body":"# What is IPv6Droid?\r\n\r\nIPv6Droid is currently an Android client for SixXS tunnels, in order to bring IPv6 support to Android mobile devices on networks that do not support IPv6 (specifically, all mobile networks in Germany at the time of writing).\r\n\r\n# What is required to get IPv6 on my device?\r\n\r\nYou'll need an account at SixXS and apply there for an AYIYA tunnel. This service is free of cost, but you will be asked some person-related data and a statement what use you're going to make with your tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe about only thing there you could make wrong with using your tunnel with IPv6Droid is to apply for something different than an AYIYA tunnel. IPv6Droid does not support all the options of the AICCU client available from SixXS.\r\n\r\nI am using Android Studio already to develop. I didn't test yet to build the project from a fresh checkout, so some required resources might be missing. If so, this is not intentional, and I'll be happy to help out solving the problem.\r\n\r\nAn official version of IPv6Droid is available via [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.flyingsnail.ipv6droid).\r\n\r\nYou need an Android device running Android 4.0 or later.\r\n\r\n**You don't need root at your Android device.**\r\n\r\n# What is the current state of IPv6Droid?\r\n\r\nThe software is right now in the state that should fit users with an interest in IPv6.\r\n\r\nPlease also see the open tickets!\r\n# What are the design goals? Why have you written this tool?\r\n\r\nGoal 1: An IPv6 solution for Android without the need to root the device.\r\n\r\nGoal 2: Keeping up the tunnel in changing networks without triggering the \"do not restart the TIC client\" policy of SixXS.\r\n\r\nGoal 3: Usable by end users.\r\n\r\nGoal 1 and 2 are met by the codebase as of 25th August 2013.\r\n\r\nGoal 3 partially, I hope, with the release of 3rd September.\r\n\r\n# Licenses\r\n\r\nFor different parts of the app, different licenses apply.\r\n\r\n* [[License for Android specific sources]]\r\n* [[License for protocol specific sources]]\r\n* [[License for Google icons]]\r\n\r\n\r\n# Can I contribute?\r\n\r\nI put IPv6Droid under GPL. You're very welcome to contribute!\r\n\r\n# Privacy statement\r\n\r\nPlease find the privacy statement (in German) under the following link:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flying-snail.de/datenschutzrichtlinie.html#ipv6droid\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
